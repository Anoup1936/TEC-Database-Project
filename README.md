# Database Project
This is a project I worked on for a college database class. 
The purpose of this project was to showcase my ability to send data to and retrieve data from a database using a simple HTML page.

The project contains the following files:
- One HTML page to serve as the UI for the project along with an accompanying stylesheet
- Two PHP files used to communicate between the database and the webpage
- One PHP file used to create the database and all the tables it contains
- A SQL file containing all the queries necessary to initialize the database with starting data in order to showcase the funcionality of the project
- A data dictionary 
- The final report containing a more detailed explanation of the project and diagrams used for designing the database
